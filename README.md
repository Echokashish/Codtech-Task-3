Financial Dashboard Analysis
1. Overall Financial Performance (2018â€“2023)
Revenue: Total revenue over the six years is 505.51M, with consistent annual revenue exceeding 50M. This reflects strong business growth and steady income streams.
Profit: Total profit is 103.15M, which accounts for ~20.4% of total revenue. The relatively low profit margin suggests significant room for improvement in managing operational costs.
Expenses: Expenses have shown an increasing trend, closely following revenue growth but at a faster pace, potentially limiting profit growth.

2. Key Observations by Visualization
A. Sum of Expenses and Profit (Area Chart)
Trend Analysis:
Expenses: Display a steady increase year-over-year, with occasional peaks, especially post-2021. These spikes could be attributed to scaling operations or unforeseen costs.
Profit: Shows smaller fluctuations compared to expenses, indicating stability but limited growth. Profit trends appear constrained by rising expenses.
B. Profit and Revenue Comparison (Bar Chart)
Revenue vs. Profit:
Revenue has been significantly higher compared to profit, with profit remaining a smaller fraction of revenue. This highlights the need for better cost management to enhance profitability.
While revenue remained steady, profit growth was relatively flat across the years.
C. Yearly Metrics Distribution (Treemap)
The treemap reveals proportional allocations:
Revenue consistently dominates all years.
Expenses, particularly in 2019 and 2018, occupy a considerable share, which likely hindered profit margins in those years.
2023 shows a higher revenue allocation but with rising expenses, which may indicate challenges in sustaining profit growth.
3. Performance Insights
Strong Revenue Streams: The business has shown consistent revenue performance, indicating resilience and effective income-generation strategies.
Rising Costs: Expenses are a major concern, with their increasing trend limiting profit potential.
Moderate Profit Margins: At around 20%, the profit margin is stable but could be improved by enhancing operational efficiency and cost control.
Recommendations
Cost Optimization:

Breakdown Expenses: Conduct a detailed review of cost contributors, especially for operational and administrative expenses.
Efficiency Measures: Implement strategies such as automation, process optimization, and renegotiation of supplier contracts.
Boost Profitability:

Pricing Strategies: Evaluate pricing models to ensure better revenue-to-profit conversion.

Margin Focus: Set higher profit margin targets by reducing unnecessary expenditure.

Sustain Revenue Growth:
Diversify Income Sources: Expand into new markets or services to ensure steady growth and reduce risk of dependency on a few sources.

Market Strategies: Invest in marketing and customer acquisition to sustain or boost revenue levels.

Yearly Performance Review:Pay special attention to 2023, which has the highest revenue figures but shows signs of rising costs. Address these issues proactively to sustain profitability.

Leverage Data Insights:Use dashboards to monitor real-time financial metrics and set KPIs for expenses, profit margins, and revenue growth. Align these KPIs with quarterly reviews for better decision-making.
